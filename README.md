# Lesson-5 Links

In this lesson I learned:


- the difference between absoulte, relative and internal references
- how to add links to another page
- how to add download links
- how to use anchor links
- best practices regarding link names
- not to include email directly in page (may be harvested by "search spiders" (use contact form instead))

*Changed some code in CSS for link colors (active, visited, etc)
